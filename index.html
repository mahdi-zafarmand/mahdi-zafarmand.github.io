I worked on Social Network Analysis under the supervision of <a href="https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~zaiane/">Osmar R. Za√Øane</a> 
and <a href="https://perso.univ-st-etienne.fr/largeron/">Christine Largeron</a>. My MSc. thesis title is

I am generally interested in Software Engineering, Machine Learning and its broad range of applications in Data Mining, Data Science, etc.
Currently, I'm working on developing Meerkat, a data analytic tool for analyzing changes over time in a network of entities.
